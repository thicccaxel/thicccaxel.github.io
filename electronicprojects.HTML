    <h2> Office work</h2> 
    <p> 
       for office worker who spend most of their time sitting in the office and meeting people you would want to go with some things that looks fancy and professional such as the samsung galaxy note 10 , Iphone X , note 20 ,etc you wouldn't want to go with something with a lot of power like the asus ROG phone 5 or black shark 2 pro as because they look unproffesional

<p> 
    for a gamer, who uses phones for more on power and performance they would need a phone with a alot of RAM and a strong cpu. They would also need a screen with high refresh rate the perfect phone for most gamers are the ROG phone 5 , Blackshark 4  and more. Gaming phones usually have a lot of accessories that can boost the player or phones performance like the Asus ROG phone 5 that have a seperate controller and the blackshark 2 pro that comes with a controller and the black shark 2 pro that comes with a joycon (a type controller used in the nintendo swwitch)
    although a little pricey the performance will worth every penny

<H2>Office</H2>
<p>for office use I may suggest getting a laptop that looks professional and light like a macbook pro or a common notebook. You wouldn't want to bring a asus rog strix G15 for a meeting with your client do you?
for office use i might suggest a Asus vivobook , zenbook or maybe a macbook if you want to use it for common office use I'm sure those are enough power for the common office work
